Changes:
	Created collection and model
	Made bootstrap fetch the collection prior to rendering
	Render now takes JSONified collection

Changes:
	Added event for keydown on create task
	Created method on view for creating a task abstracted from UI event which leverages create -- Note comment on why it's here, not in the model
	Bind to all events on collection
	On almost all events, render.  Leaving off things like parse are a good idea.

Changes:
	Added data-task-id attribute to template for hook
	Bound to the change event of completion checkbox
	Implemented completeTask which gets the appropriate model, changes it and saves

Changes:
	Added property for task filter
	Modified template to include links for switching filter
	Bound to click events for setting filters
	Created function for setting filters on the view and rendering
	Updating render to look for filter and manipulate the collection

Changes:
	Updated template to include link for deleting
	Bound to the event and called delete method
	Updated template to include link for deleting everything
	Bound to the event and called delete all method
	Optimized deletion to only render once instead of after every delete

Changes:
	Split out template to only have a placeholder for the list (now a DIV).  task.html now contains the template for a specific task.
	Imported additional dependency for taskView.
	Created renderTask for creating and rendering subview.
	Created renderTasks for looping through all tasks in a collection
	Updated render filtering to create a collection so as to pass models to the subview
	Only passing necessary data to parent render
	Updated render to loop through collection and call renderTask for each model constructing a UL
	Moved all events and methods that are specific to a task into taskView
	Updated methods in taskView to point at own model rather than finding by ID.
