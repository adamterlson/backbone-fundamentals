##Usage

Navigate to folder where you pulled the code down to and start the Node/Express server:

- `npm install`  This will install all of the node dependencies.
- `node server.js`  Run the server!

Then navigate to: `localhost:8000`

##Annotated

Check out /public/js/annotated to see annotated source files for the different sections, what they are for, conventions to follow, things to avoid etc.  Right now only the view is complete.  More to come.

##Troubleshooting

If the server fails to start, make sure nothign else is running on port 8000.
