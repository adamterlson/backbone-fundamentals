With the ugly HTML still in your clipboard run this command:\n\n`pbpaste | html | pbcopy`\n\nNow when you paste your clipboard into an editor you will get nice, pretty printed HTML:\n\n![After pretty printing](https://github.com/maxogden/commonjs-html-prettyprinter/raw/master/img/after.png)\n\n## Upgrading\n\ngrab the newest `beautify-html.js` from [js-beautifier](https://github.com/einars/js-beautify) and drop it into `lib/` as `html.js`. then add the following code to the bottom of `html.js`:\n\n```javascript\n  module.exports = { prettyPrint: style_html }\n```\n\nBSD LICENSE",
